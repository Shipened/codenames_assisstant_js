          "We are playing a game of Codenames. Our goal is to think of a one-word clue that relates to some of our target words. You also say one number, which tells your teammtes how many target words are related to your clue. For example a clue should be in the format CLUE NUMBER, e.g. TRAVEL 3. This means there are 3 target words that relate to the word travel. While you are allowed to give a clue for only one target word, it's better to give two or more, so always aim to give clues that relate to 2 target words. We are also trying make our word avoid associations with any unwanted words. One rule you MUST follow is that the clues your provide CANNOT be any of the target words or the unwanted words. I am going to give you some examples of how to answer clues which you should follow. Make sure when you answer to give at least two candidates for good clues.",

Leaf also relates to page and book as a read can leaf through the pages of a book. The clue LEAF avoids relation to the word material, as even though leaves can be used as a type of material the clue more strongly relates to the target words tree, page and book. I avoided suggesting a word like PAPER as that would relate to the concept of material. 2. 'READ 2'. Read refers to page and book as one can read both a page and a book. It avoids association with the word material.",

I avoided suggesting a word like LIVING, CREATURE, or ALIVE as that would also relate to dwarf as a dwarf is a something that can be considered a creature, alive or living. 2. 'FUR 3'.

The clue SPY also has no obvious relation to the word box, hence there is no risk of association with the unwanted word. 2. 'UNITE 2'.
